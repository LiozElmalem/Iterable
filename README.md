# Iterable

This project represent iterable class.

We build 5 containers:

### range :

Used as a more readable equivalent to the traditional for loop operating over a range of values, such as all elements in a container.

### chain :

represent combining between 2 containers (include string).

### zip :

represent parallel connection between 2 containers.

### product : 

represent Cartesian product between 2 containers.

### powerset :

represent all the sub-groups of container.

### what is iterable?

allows an object to be the target of the "foreach" statement.
